KCHA transforms distressed communities through well-designed, higher density, mixed-income housing that utilize energy and water saving technologies.

## Project Description 
In this project, analysis is conducted on a dataset containing housing details from the King County, USA, the region where the city of Seattle is located. 
This is an end to end machine learning project which includes EDA and Predictive modelling using the various forms of regression. Linear Regeression, Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression


## Dataset Description:
The dataset used in this project was obtained from [source1](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction?)<br>
<br>
The dataset contains 21 features and  21613 observations. The features include,
* price
* bedrooms
* bathrooms
* condition
* sqft_above

## Goal:

The analysis seeks to find;

* Explore the dataset
* Correlation analysis
* Outlier analysis
* Predict housing prices using machine learning
